Sexual recombination enables selective elimination of deletrious mtuations and thus repairs genetic lineages with mutational damage. Muller (1964) pointed out one way in which this can happen. An asexual individual can only produce offspring with a number of mutations that is either the same or higher than its own if reversions(mutations fully restoring the orignal function) are so rare that we can safely ignore them. Consequently, the number of deleterious mutations in the genome of an asexual lineage will tend to increase over time. At best it could stay constant if the population size is so large that selection maintains genomes in which on new mutations have occured, but even in large populuations with very small deleterious effects will accumulate. Small asexual populations accumulate mutations faster than large populations. This process is called Muller's Ratchet. In a sexual population, in constrast, an optimal genotype lost by drift can be reconstituted by recombination. Ch8 pg189
