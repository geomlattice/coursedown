# Muller's Ratchet

> Small asexual populations accumulate mutations faster than large population. This process is called Muller's Ratchet. In a sexual population, in contrast, an optimal genotype lost by drift can be reconstituted by [recombination](./recombination.md). [pg189 Textbook](../ch8_highlights.md)

Muller's Ratchet appears in [Problem Set 3.7](../pset3_attempt.md) in the context of the Y Chromosome:

> In this problem, you will use simulations of Muller's Ratchet to gain insight into the Y's history and future
