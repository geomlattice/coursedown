# Lecture 5: Overview to Immune Signalling

Pset 2 covers up to the content in this lecture. Pset 3 covers everything after this up to lecture 9.

I accidentally set the prof off on a tangent about the Transformer Chatbots so minute 11:30 still hasn't yet had any content advanced yet. The class laughed at his response to my question and so I guess he rode the wave: "We're navigating these tools, what can I say?" This reminds me to catch up in Machine Learning before we go over how the Transformer Chatbots actually work in too much detail.

Signalling pathways tend to be centalized in some way. There is common machinery using different patterns such as growth factors to enact the world of cytokine signalling and immune effector signalling. 

Where do cells go? This question suggests Homing and Chemotaxis 

What do cells do?

Survival? Imagine a T Cell. Growth and Differentiation (eg cell-type transition) 

Signalling concept to be mindful of: Location of signalling: 

1. Autocrine (signalling to self)

2. Paracrine (signalling to surroundings)

3. Endocrine(signalling to whole body)

More concepts:

1. Pleiotropy: one signal, different effects

Cytokines are immune specific growth factors

One often finds the pattern IL-XX where IL means interleukin(which means between two immune cells) - communication and differnitation between immune cells happens via them.

IL-4 in different cells will cause very different effects

2. Redudancy: Many Signal, Same effect

Swiss Cheese model, multiple agents observing same movement of matter

3. Synergy: Two signals give you more than you would expect adding them

Co-association seems quite common. eg if X, alarm quanta 3/10 if Y 3/10 if X && X alarm quanta 11/10

4. Antagonism: One signal blocks another

Alot of things in the immune system are poised to act but not yet acting. Some signals are self-perpetuating. Once you commence A, often B will blocked to continue the path afforded by A.

Many names in immunology come from order of discovery, which does not align well with the systems that these molecules have been implicated within. This is considered to be like learning a foriegn language. The Categories of Being: knowing what IL-2 is similar to knowing how ask where the bathroom is.

There are 6 major Cytokine Families:

1. Interleukin-1 Family: Inflammation

2. Class 1 (Hematopoietin) Cytokine Family: Immune Growth/Differentiation

3. Class 2 (interferon) Cytokine Family: largely alpha-viral, ubiquitously expressed

4. Tumor Necrosis Factor Family: Inflammatory/Immue Survival Factors

5. Interleukin-17 Family: Neutrophils/pro-inflammatory, recently discovered in last 15-20 years

6. Chemokines: GPCR, chemoattractant function - tells cells where to go in the body
