# March

It is the middle of March and I don't have a grip on this class. I was distracted during the time that would have been best for making progress on the first problem set, and then I didn't even really register when the due date for the second one was. I am aware that the next one is due in 3 days and that I must complete every problem set in this class, meaning the outstanding problem set 2 must be completed. I have just ordered the textbook, and the chapters which correspond to problem sets 1 and 2 with the exception of chatper 6-7 have been posted to the course website. The topics for problem set 3 are in the textbook that should arrive for me on Weds if everything goes as expected. I expect wobble and variance there. I hope that lecture notes will be good to work as a support for problem set 3. 

I am thinking of warming up by marking down the textbook entries that are avaiable. Then I plan to scan the textbook chapter by chapter and upload them to the webarchive such that OCR scripts will generate text that I can quickly copy and paste into markdown with ease. I hope to then embed references or pointers from problem set problems in markdown to the textbook entries that are relevant. The idea here is an association web of citations that show how things are connected and allow for cohesive studying where concepts form through the process of the speaking subject coming to know.

I have commited the problems for set 2 to paper but I have yet work them out. I will need to begin with lecture material before looking at the textbook. There likely will be something of purchase there in my surverying. I shall update the TODO list as such.

Problem Set 3 is due tommorrow. I do not know if I should pay attention to this due date, as my textbook just arrived. What I have decided is that I shall read the textbook entries that are associated with the third problem set and I shall keep an eye out for correspondences between the text and the problems that are expected for me as ready-to-hand.

I would like to digitize the textbook, but to do it well takes time that I cannot sacrifice. I will have to just read the textbook and stick to the dimension of paper for now.

After reading Chapter 8 of the textbook for about 20 minutes I've come to realize that an appropriate strategy may be to keep a highlight log for the chapters wherein such a move is supported by the presupposition that most of the text is of low value and there are hotspots of information.
