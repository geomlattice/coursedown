I have completely checked out for about 3 weeks and there is the sole midterm of the course in 3 days. I must graduate. I seek to pass all my classes. I have brought about an academic debt and I must attend to it. I watch the 2 lectures I hvae remaining, and I will read through the solutions posted for work I have not submittd. I intend to do more of the work that is yet due. I wish to stop dodging assignments, and so I hope to undermine the undermining of my error, this mortal flesh in the sense of Saint Paul, that great Saint of the Merkavah Tradtion.
