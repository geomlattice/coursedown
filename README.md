Markdown notes transcription of class notes

Math mode in markdown on github is the motor of this project. This entire file system is intended to be readable from github as latex math.

I am currently behind in courses and I would like to organize everything with markdown. It's all fun and games with Hegel, but it is time for me to get serious. For some reason I am devoted to markdown transcription as a method of textual engagement. After meeting obligations for assignments the best I can given my muddled dialectic of habit, I hope to reconsolidate knowledge. I want every git push to bring me closert to learning my course content, and I want everything I have collected to be stored here.

I intend to store lecture notes and problem set explanations as study material. Hegel is not more important than what is in the Syallabus. Kant and Aristotle are not on my exams. I am responsible for coming into genuine contact with the problems assigned to me. I cannot be trusted in this world if I cannot meet these obligations with not only the courage of the moment but also with faith in the process itself. I am here to learn, and everything I would ever throw at Hegel or Lacan should first be cast towards my coursework. 

Within this markdown directory lies a banal struggle that pierces to the depths of the heart with a dull putrification. May I embrace the contradictions as I aspire towarda sublation in the Dynamic Event of Being.
